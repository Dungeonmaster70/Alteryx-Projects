Alteryx Project Showcase
I have worked on multiple end-to-end projects demonstrating strong skills in data preparation, transformation, and analytics using Alteryx Designer across diverse domains like retail, credit card fraud detection, and supply chain management.

1. Retail Messy Data ETL & Analytics
Handled messy retail sales data by performing data cleansing, deduplication, and aggregation to prepare clean, analysis-ready datasets. Key tools used:
Input Data, Data Cleansing, Filter, Select, Multi-Row Formula, Join, Summarize, Sort, Output Data

2. Credit Card Fraud Detection Workflow
Developed fraud detection workflows incorporating feature engineering, rolling window calculations, and risk scoring to identify suspicious transactions. Dealt with highly imbalanced data and multiple data sources. Key tools used:
Input Data, Formula, Multi-Row Formula, Filter, Join, Batch Macro, Summarize, Output Data

3. Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard
Built workflows to integrate supplier, inventory, and order data to calculate KPIs like inventory turnover and order fulfillment efficiency, enabling actionable insights for supply chain optimization. Key tools used:
Input Data, Select, Formula, Join, Date & Time, Summarize, Sort, Output Data

This combined showcase highlights my ability to manage complex data workflows, automate processes, and deliver scalable analytics solutions using Alteryx.
